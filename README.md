# Noted: A Hackathon Project

*Noted!* makes notetaking less stressful. It utilizes Open-CV and Gemini to understand your notes and provide a summary, quiz you on them, or convert them to a document. It uses CustomTkinter to make a basic GUI where you can read the summary, questions, and more!


## Setting it up

In order to start using it on your machine, you must have Python installed. Next, you will enter the Python virtual environment by entering this command in PowerShell:<br>
<code>noted\Scripts\activate</code>

Then, the required packages and dependencies will have to be installed:<br>
<code>pip install -U -n google-generative-ai</code><br>
<code>pip install opencv-python</code><br>
<code>pip install customtkinter</code><br>
<br>
Now, you should be fine and ready to go with this final command:<br>
<code>python front_end.py</code>
